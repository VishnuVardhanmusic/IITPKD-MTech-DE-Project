# IITPKD MTech Data Engineering Course Project
## SVS DATA ANALYTICS - MOVIE DATA ANALYSIS AND INSIGHTS VISUALIZATION
## Basic Problem Statement 
1) You are provided with a CSV file containing detailed information about movies, 
including metadata such as titles, genres, cast, directors, budget, revenue, release 
dates, and more. 
2) Perform the necessary data pre-processing and analysis on the given dataset to clean, 
normalize, and extract meaningful insights. 
3) Design a relational database schema to store this movie data, organizing it in a way 
that optimizes queries and supports complex relationships between entities (such as 
actors, directors, etc.). 
4) Develop a dashboard that can connect to the designed database and visualize various 
aspects of the data.

 ## Tech Stack used
1) Data Pre-Processing: Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Numpy 
2) DataBase Management: PostgreSQL, pgAdmin 4, SQLAlchemy 
3) Visualization and Dashboard: plotly, dash
